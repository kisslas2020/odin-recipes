    <h2>Description</h2>

    Tender squash, gooey cheese and crunchy crackers make this a memorable side dish or a hearty main course. This is a
    great dish that can be made with low-fat ingredients and is still just as good!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 cups sliced yellow squash</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>35 buttery round crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>

    <p>Place squash and onion in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in a small amount of water. Cover, and cook
        until squash is tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well, and place in a large bowl.</p>

    <p>In a medium bowl, mix together cracker crumbs and cheese. Stir half of the cracker mixture into the cooked squash
        and onions. In a small bowl, mix together eggs and milk, then add to squash mixture. Stir in 1/4 cup melted
        butter, and season with salt and pepper. Spread into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining cracker
        mixture, and dot with 2 tablespoons butter.</p>

    <p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until lightly browned.</p>
