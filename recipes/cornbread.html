    <h2>Description</h2>

    This recipe comes from my mother-in-law in Canada. It's the most moist corn bread that I have ever tasted. It's
    great with chili con carne or as stuffing for your holiday turkey.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups cornmeal</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs/li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine cornmeal and milk; let stand for 5
        minutes. Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.</p>

    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Mix in the cornmeal mixture, eggs and oil
        until smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan.</p>

    <p>Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center of the cornbread comes out
        clean.</p>
